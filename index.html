<h3>Short Bio</h3>

<p>
    I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft working in the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/networking/">Azure Networking</a> organization.
</p>

<p>
    I graduated from the <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> with a Masters in Computer Science in Spring 2020 where I was advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yliang/">Prof. Yingyu Liang</a>.
    I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, and currently researching on transfer learning of sentence embeddings in Natural Language Processing and robustness of Computer Vision models to distributional shift.
    Prior to this, I graduated from the <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a> with B.E.(Hons.) in Computer Science in Spring 2016.
