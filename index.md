### Short Bio

I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft working in the [Azure Networking](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/networking/) organization.

I graduated from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) with a Masters in Computer Science in Spring 2020 where I was advised by [Prof. Yingyu Liang](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yliang/).
I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, and currently researching on transfer learning of sentence embeddings in Natural Language Processing and robustness of Computer Vision models to distributional shift.

Prior to this, I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with B.E.(Hons.) in Computer Science in Spring 2016.

### Recent Updates

- Our work on "Beyond Fine-tuning: Few-Sample Sentence Embedding Transfer" has been accepted to appear in [AACL-IJCNLP 2020](http://aacl2020.org/).
